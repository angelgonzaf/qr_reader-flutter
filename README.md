# qr_app

A new Flutter project for scanning QR Codes and saving them on the storage.

## Getting Started

This project uses the Google Maps API. You need to register in https://console.cloud.google.com/ , activate the API "Maps SDK for Android" and "Maps SDK for IOS" (If you want to build your app for IOS). Then, create an API KEY and, for Android, paste it in android\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml , inside the tag "<meta-data>"
  
For IOS, paste the Key in ios\Runner\AppDelegate.swift

Then the Map will work properly.
